# Welcome to my pages

I am Bin Wan, a doctoral researcher at Otto Hahn Group Cognitive Neurogenetics [<img align="right" width="180" height="180" src="https://github.com/wanb-psych/wanb-psych.github.io/blob/main/src/icons/cng_logo.jpg"> (CNG)](https://cng-lab.github.io) lab led by Dr. Sofie Valk.<br/>

I have an interdisciplinary background and have followed a unique path in academia so far. My bachelor major is to analyze chemical materials and microbes in the air, water, food, and blood. Master major focused on epidemiology and mental health. At the same time I made a lot of friendships that helped me both personally and professionally during good and more difficult times. This made me realize that the key to enjoyment in science is collaboration, and since then I collaborate intensively with others who have a shared interest in social psychology and health. During employment in Beijing, I focused on optical stimuli and visual impacts/learning.<br/>

Now my PhD is cognitive neuroscience. I am working on the inter-hemispheric differences in how cortical cortex is organized. I employ multiple measures including resting state functional MRI, T1w/T2w mapping, quantitative T1 relaxometry, histological cell-boby staining, genetics, topology, and machine learning to study the human brain and macaque brain.<br/>

Please contact me if you are interested in a collaboration focusing on cognitive neuroscience and social psychology, or learn more about my research.
